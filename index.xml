I’m pursuing courses in business communication, consumer behavior, and marketing research. Energized by my passion for psychology, I can empathize with the customer by understanding their needs and how the product can bring value to their lives. Outside of SFSU, I continuously research the latest marketing trends and take relevant coursework to further my professional development.</description></item></channel></rss>
