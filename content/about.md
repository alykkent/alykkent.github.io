## About Me:

I’m a full-time student at San Francisco State University, majoring in Business Administration with a marketing concentration. I’m pursuing courses in business communication, consumer behavior, and marketing research. Energized by my passion for psychology, I can empathize with the customer by understanding their needs and how the product can bring value to their lives. Outside of SFSU, I continuously research the latest marketing trends and take relevant coursework to further my professional development. The professional courses and my academic coursework have led me to two marketing internships. My first marketing internship was for The University of Mississippi’s Student Housing. I learned how to market student housing and amenities to prospective students and host student housing events. My most recent marketing internship was for Hyperflyer, a San Francisco-based start-up focused on promoting local businesses. I generated content creation and promoted their social media brand. As I progress through SFSU, I'm interested in gaining more marketing experience.
