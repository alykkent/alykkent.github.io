## about me

I’m a full-time student at San Francisco State University, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. In my academic career I’m pursuing courses in Business Communication, Consumer behavior and marketing research. Energized by my passion in psychology, I have an ability to empathize with the customer, by understanding their needs and how the product can bring value to their lives. Outside of SFSU, I continuously research the latest marketing trends and take relevant coursework to further my professional development. The professional courses and my academic coursework have led me to three marketing internships. The first marketing internship I had was at Aramark. At Aramark I learned how to converse with potential clients and convert into paid customers. As well as plan and host marketing events. My next marketing internship was for The University of Mississippi’s Student Housing. While there I learned how to market student housing and amenities to prospective students, as well as host student housing campus events. My most recent marketing internship was for Hyperflyer, a San Francisco based start-up that focused on promoting local businesses. I focused on content creation and promoted their social media brand.
