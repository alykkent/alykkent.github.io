## About Me:
I’m a full-time student at San Francisco State University, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. I’m pursuing courses in business communication, consumer behavior, and marketing research in my academic career. Energized by my passion for psychology, I can empathize with the customer by understanding their needs and how the product can bring value to their lives. Outside of SFSU, I continuously research the latest marketing trends and take relevant coursework to further my professional development. The professional courses and my academic coursework have led me to three marketing internships. The first marketing internship I had was at Aramark. At Aramark, I learned how to converse with potential clients and convert them into paid customers. My next marketing internship was for The University of Mississippi’s Student Housing. While there, I learned how to market student housing and amenities to prospective students. My most recent marketing internship was for Hyperflyer, a San Francisco-based start-up focused on promoting local businesses. I created content and promoted their social media brand. As I progress through SFSU, I am open to gaining more experience.
